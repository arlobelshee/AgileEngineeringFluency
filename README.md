Agile Engineering Fluency
=========================

A model for understanding how teams develop the technical practices over time.

This is a fluency model: we lay out the stages of proficiency, and find that teams progress through these proficiencies, developing fluency (or not) with each before moving on.

The results a team gets are determined by which stages they are fluent at. Partial / developing fluency at a stage does not change the team's results much. Full fluency does.

The model is shown at [http://arlobelshee.github.io/AgileEngineeringFluency/](http://arlobelshee.github.io/AgileEngineeringFluency/)
