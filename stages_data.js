You should resist the temptation to fill an iteration to capacity, even with lower priority stories that can be moved out if time runs out. Doing this often results in half-finished functionality and can be detrimental to a team's morale when it appears that they have not finished what they committed to. Slack acts as a buffer to the customer which contributes to a teams ability to sustain a productive pace indefinitely. However, teams should not confuse the deliberate act of adding slack into an iteration with the act of padding their estimates (i.e. overestimation) or adjusting capacity to account for busyness (e.g. by stating that developers will only have 6 hours per day of productivity).",

					"",
					"When you are first writing code, you know a lot about your currently-intended solution. But you gain knowledge about the problem between the moment you first write code and when you later read it. You get better designs when you know the problem better. You also tend to get simpler designs when you are less sure of your particular solution.",
					"",
					"Thus, reflective design results in simpler designs which are built with greater knowledge of the problem domain.",
					"",
					"In addition, reflective design only happens when you read code. Any system has a fair amount of code which is written and then never (or rarely) modified. It isn't worth designing those parts carefully. If you improve the design a little (but not completely) every time you read it, then you will spend the most design time on the parts off the solution that turn out to be read most often. And those are exactly the parts where good design pays the highest benefit.",
